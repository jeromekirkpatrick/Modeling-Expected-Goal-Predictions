Capstone 2

1. Sentiment analysis - [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)

I'm thinking to to do sentiment analysis of reviews for aggregates of small businesses that don't individually get enough reviews to make strong conclusions about the range of feedback reviews provide by picking an industry or a few and a region of a certain size. What sort of shape would our dataset be good to fall within?

2. Image classification - [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. 

Here are the classes in the dataset:
airplane										
automobile										
bird										
cat										
deer										
dog										
frog										
horse										
ship										
truck
